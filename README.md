# Number-Game

#### Here is my first offical python project! It has 3 levels and it exits when a user response is no (or something related) or when they have no more lives. It took me a while to figure out how to not make the program exit whenever a user input wasn't a number but I finally got it! Please give me suggestions on what I could've done better on this but Overall, I am very proud!
